    <h2 class="question">Question 1 : Are your card uses or users of such a nature that cards are likely to wear out? </h2>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>Here the issue is card durability, which is enhanced by lamination. Laminated cards have a thin clear polyester film applied to the card surface that prevents printing on the card surface from fading or wearing away. Lamination extends card longevity and reduces time and cost of frequent card replacement.</p>
